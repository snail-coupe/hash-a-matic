# hash-a-matic

This is my all purpose toy bot.

It considers of abstract `BotAccount` and `BotCmd` classes, some glue code to automatically find and register all subclasses, and a cli to allow posting of the BotCmd results to a BotAccount

## `BotAccount`

`Tumblr` and `Mastodon` are supported.  `Twitter` was deprecated at the end of 2022.

## `BotCmd`

All sorts of fractal/procedural image generation.
